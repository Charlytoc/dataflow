It's a very simple minimalistic project to clean and deploy datasets in real time using python. Its ideal for small and mid-sized organizations that want to deploy into production a data-processing solution with very few steps and cheap costs. It supports **[batch](#running-in-batch)** and **[streaming](#streaming-data-into-pipelines)** processing and it comes with a tool to [quickly test pipline](#unit-testing-your-pipeline).

Deploy in heroku in minutes, create pipelines of data with multiple python functions to clean your dataset and save it into CSV, SQL or BigQuery.
